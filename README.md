# Portfolio Review

## Introduction
Portfolio Review is an investment research tool that allows users to analyze hypothetical portfolios they may be interested in as well as keep track of any financial securities or companies they are interested in.

## Home

## Portfolios
Allows users to create a portfolio and add securities to it by typing in the ticker of each security they wish to add. Users must select the asset class of each security they add in order to view the asset allocation breakdown of their portfolio. Users can edit the portfolio's information and change the securities in the portfolio. Portfolios that are no longer needed can be deleted.

### Details
The portfolio details page shows users a breakdown of which securities are in the portfolio and includes a pie chart of the portfolio's asset allocation. Users can view the portfolio's historical performance for 1, 2, or 5 years by clicking on the respective links. Performance metrics include return for the period, compound annual growth rate (CAGR), standard deviation, and a chart that shows the hypothetical performance of a 100,000 portfolio.

## Securities
The securities tab allows users to view basic information about companies/financial securities, including their name, ticker symbol, and a description. The list is sorted alphabetically, and the Previous and Next buttons can be used to page through the list. Securities currently shown only include those that have already been added by other users. Users can search within the list by ticker or name with the top search bar. If you wish to see a security that is not in the list, it can be added by typing the ticker in the 'Add Security' search bar.
